While I can't access real-time market data right now, here are some fundamental principles for successful trading:

üìä **Key Trading Factors:**
- **Risk Management**: Never risk more than 2-3% of your portfolio on a single trade

- **Diversification**: Spread investments across different sectors and assets
- **Market Timing**: Consider market conditions and economic indicators
- **Emotional Control**: Stick to your strategy and avoid impulsive decisions
